Check the Figma UAT page for design review annotations.

1. Fetch Figma node `87:785` (UAT page) from file `4Hjq9g7eLr2XTNMmon4oQD` using the Figma MCP tool
2. Also check node `106:1197` (after character selection) and `92:1194` (after adding a reminder) for any new annotations
3. List all text annotations found — these are design feedback items
4. For each annotation, identify:
   - What screen/element it refers to
   - What change is requested
   - Whether it's already been addressed in the current code
5. Summarize: which items are done, which need work
